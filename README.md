## Dog Breed Identification

The Dog Breed Identification project is a machine learning-based application designed to classify and identify different dog breeds from images. This project combines computer vision techniques and a trained model to deliver accurate breed predictions. It serves as a demonstration of applying artificial intelligence in practical scenarios such as animal identification and pet care.

Features :-

Image Classification: Predicts the breed of a dog from an input image. Pre-Trained Models: Utilizes state-of-the-art models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition and classification. Accurate Predictions: Supports multiple dog breeds with high accuracy. Interactive Interface: Provides an easy-to-use platform for users to upload images and view results. Scalability: Can be extended to include more breeds or related features like animal health insights.

Tech Stack :- Frontend: Python-based libraries for visualization (e.g., Streamlit, Flask). Backend: Machine learning model developed using TensorFlow or PyTorch. Dataset: Trained on publicly available datasets like the Stanford Dogs Dataset or Kaggleâ€™s dog breed datasets. Deployment: Deployed on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) or accessible locally.

## How It Works :-

Data Preprocessing: The input image is resized, normalized, and processed to meet the model's requirements. Prediction: The trained model analyzes the image and predicts the breed with a probability score. Result Display: The identified breed, along with confidence levels, is presented to the user. Feedback: Users can provide feedback to improve model performance over time (optional).

Applications :-

Pet Care: Assists pet owners and vets in identifying dog breeds accurately. Rescue and Adoption: Helps shelters identify mixed breeds and provide accurate details for adoption purposes. Learning Tool: Provides an educational tool for learning about different dog breeds.

Installation and Setup :-

Clone the repository: bash Copy code git clone 

Install the required dependencies:

bash Copy code pip install -r requirements.txt

If you want projects similar to this found those on here -- "Kaggle.com".

To get this project datasets and related things to be done, visit this -- "https://www.kaggle.com/code/dansbecker/exercise-intro-to-dl-for-computer-vision/input"

There you will get codes and data sets for your projects. If you are newbie of using google colab, try there on the Kaggle Notebook. It is also a freindly platform to try your code.

## Steps to build project

Load the dataset from Kaggle. IMPORTANT Download Data set from Here :https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data

Load labels from CSV for lables that contain an image ID and breed.

Checking the breed count.

ONT-HOT Encoding on lables data PREDIC.TION column.

Load the images, Convert them to an array & nirmalize them.

Check the shape and size of the X and Y Data.

Building the model Network Architecture.

Split the data and fir it into the model and create new accuracy point.

Evaluate the model for accuracy score.

Using the model for prediction.

NOTE: This project will take about 1 hour to run Depends on your computer
